# STACS
Simulation Tool for Asynchronous Cortical Streams

Documentation is in /docs (but there are some conventions that are yet undocumented)

## TODO
- combine genet-build into the main stacs executable so that it has access to models for default state initialization (and yml files no longer need to be in named order)
- code in eventprop on top of episodic simulation to supply gradients to synapse weights
- more documentation
