# STACS
Simulation Tool for Asynchronous Cortical Streams

Documentation is in /docs (but there are some conventions that are yet undocumented)

## TODO
- code in eventprop on top of episodic simulation to supply gradients to synapse weights
- drop in simple cortical neuron models (and cortical microcircuit configs)
- generate graph files for large-scale dentate model
- tentative: combine genet-build into the main stacs executable so that it has access to models for default state initialization (and yml files no longer need to be in named order)
- more documentation
